                      <p style="text-align:justify;">Anne Lammott explores these words in depth and beautifully in her work, “Stitches: A Handbook on Meaning, Hope and Repair.”</p>

                      <p style="text-align: justify">When there is a personality this eminent, this instrumental and this influential, it is difficult,
almost impossible, to find a way to have a single article reflect all that deserves to be reflected.
We can only try to make the reader get a glimpse, if not a picture, of just how much goes into
becoming someone who lives on, not only as an able engineer of the past, but also of now, and in
the hearts of those who are able to live the fruits of his efforts, and in the minds of everyone who
strives for his traits and knowledge.</p>

                      <p style="text-align: justify">A.N. Moorthy Rao, a renowned author, recalls, in one of his works, a bus journey through
Mandya. As he looked out of his window, and gazed at the soul warming-greenery stretched out
as far as the eye could see, lush paddy fields, sugarcanes standing straight, almost with an air of
seriousness and keen posture, he marvelled at the district’s transformation. He recalled how it
had been nothing but a barren and thirsty land, and as he did so, a fellow companion in the bus
resounded exactly his thoughts. The companion, with his hand outstretched to the scenery
outside said, “All this is Visvesvaraya”.</p>

                      <img class="square" id ="two" src="a2.jpg" alt="" />
                      <p style="text-align:center;">Mandya Today</p>
                      </div>




                      <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">Notice how he said, “All this is Visvesvarayya” and not, “All this is Visvesvaraya’s work”. He
could not have said so more rightly. They embody all that he stood for: dedication, service and
support, to do better as a whole.</p>

                      <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify">Mandya’s flourishing fields and people. The earth quenched by the waters of the KRS dam,
which was envisioned and built by him. The rice growing there that feeds the entire state.
In all of this lies Sir M. Visvesvaraya.</p>

                      <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify">The travel companion then goes on to describe his other contributions-Bhadravati Iron and
Steel Works, State Bank of Mysore, Mysore University, Mysore Chamber of commerce.
However, before elaborating on any of these, let us begin at his beginning.</p>

                      <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify">He was born on the fifteenth of September,1861, into a Telugu brahmin family in the village of
Muddenahalli, in Chikkaballapur district to Mokshagundam Srinivasa Shastry and
Venkatalakshmamma. Part of a learned family, he too went on to show great interest in
academics.</p>




                      <div style="text-align:center;">
                      <img class="square" id ="three" src="a3.jpg" alt="" />
                      <p style="text-align:center;">Sir MV’s memorial in Muddenahalli</p>
                      </div>




                      <p style="text-align:justify">Having completed his primary education in Chikkaballapur,he came to Bangalore for his higher
education. A little known fact is that he initially studied arts and In 1881, he received a
bachelor’s degree in Arts from the Central College in Bangalore, affiliated to the Madras
University. It was after that that he moved onto pursue civil engineering from the reputed
College of Engineering, Pune.</p>

                      <p style="text-align:justify;">A dedicated student, he emerged as the topper of the university examination, and as was the
practice then, was immediately recruited into Bombay’s Public Works Department (PWD) as an
assistant engineer.</p>





                      <div style="text-align:center;">
                      <img class="square" id ="four" src="a4.jpg" alt="" />
                      <p style="text-align:center;">An excerpt from his autobiography “Memories of my working life”. (All excerpts in this article are
from the same book)</p>
                      </div>

                      <p style="text-align:justify;">His passion for his work, love for challenges and ability to navigate even the toughest of issues
with a clear head earned him the trust of the Government and the masses. Deemed as one of the
most able of engineers, he was entrusted with problems that he saw through with a keen mind
and a flair like no other. For instance, to solve the problem of reservoir overflow, he designed
automatic sluice gates which were first used in Khadakvasla Reservoir near Pune. These were
used later at Lake Fife in Michigan, Tigra Dam in Gwalior and KRS Dam in Mandya/Mysore.
This design was patented by him and the Government was more than willing to pay him a
recurring royalty for this brainchild of his. However, he sternly refused the royalty and asked the
government to put that money to use elsewhere for the welfare of the public.</p>




                      <div style="text-align:center;">
                      <img class="square" id ="two" src="a5.jpg" alt="" />
                      <p style="text-align:center;"></p>
                      </div>




                      <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">He was highly commended by one and all and in the years to come, his list of achievements only
grew, all achieved not with the spirit of fame or power, but purely in the spirit to serve and put
his mind to the best of use for the betterment of the people.</p>

                      <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify">In 1906-1907, he was sent by the Government to Aden University in Yemen to learn more about
water supply and drainage systems. The project he created during his studies there was in fact
implemented in the city of Aden.</p>







                    <div style="text-align:center;">
                      <img class="square" id ="two" src="a6.jpg" alt="" />
                      <p style="text-align:center;"></p>
                    </div>





                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">After his return, he designed a flood protection system for Hyderabad. He became a hero to the
masses when he developed a system to make Visakhapatnam port free from the threat of sea
erosion. Sir M Visvesvaraya envisioned, supervised and architectured the Krishna Raja Sagara
Dam on the Kaveri River, which ensured lives and livelihoods of several. This dam created the
biggest reservoir in Asia when it was built. Sir M. Visvesvaraya rendered valuable technical
advice for the location of Mokama Bridge over the Ganga in Bihar. He planned the city of
Jayanagar, in Bangalore and to this day, it is said to be one of the best planned cities in Asia, and
on many lists the best.</p>

                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify">Below is a timeline of his several successful endeavours and career line. Although, it is hardly
fair to condense all these incredible feats into a timeline, it would be even more unfair to leave
any out in an attempt to expand on each and every one of them.<br/>(These lists are sourced from https://www.karnataka.com)</p>

                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">Although, every one of the above deserve elaboration, it would be hardly possible to do so.
However, it is strongly urged that you do so as there are not only enough resources to do so,
including his own autobiography. More importantly, there is much to learn from each of his
efforts and this in itself is enough incentive.</p>

                      <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify">Some achievements however are so tied with his name that an article celebrating Sir MV is
simply incomplete without bringing them up. The whole of Mysore city resonates his sheer
excellence and dwells largely in the boons of his past ventures.</p>

                      <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify">Soon after his retirement from British services in 1908, Sri Krishnarajendra Wodeyar,
Maharaja of Mysore, engaged his services. Visvesvaraya was enraptured, not demotivated by the
array of challenges.</p>

                      <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify">When appointed Dewan, he served everyday in that office, strictly for the benefit of his society
and not his own. Krishnaraja Sagara Dam, built across the Kaveri river, is one of the prime water
supplies for the southern part of India and deemed one of the most brilliant engineering feats of
the country.</p>





                    <div style="text-align:center;">
                      <img class="square" id ="two" src="a9.jpg" alt="" />
                      <p style="text-align:center;"></p>
                    </div>





                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">A fond story one tells of the sanctity with he regarded his office is as follows; when he was first
named the Dewan, he is said to have laid his appointment letter down at the feet of his mother
and said that he would only accept the offer is she promised to not ask him to employ any of his
relatives simply out of favour and to not ask him to do anything that could stain his
professionalism. In fact, when a fellow relative who was already holding a government post
asked Sir MV to influence a promotion, although he greatly liked and respected this relative, he
very firmly refused to do anything of this sort.</p>

                      <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify">He would be neatly dressed, by seven in the morning everyday. There would not be a single crease in his clothing. Thus, his attitude of perfection and orderliness was not limited to his work, but reflected in every aspect of his life. He once said, “Remember, your work may be only to sweep a railway crossing, but it is your duty to keep it so clean that no other crossing in the world is as clean as yours”.</p>

                      <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify">He was an epitome of his words and was at his desk everyday till eight in the night. He would make each day count and had great respect for time and what was done with it. He was more than willing to listen to grievances and suggestions. However, he would expect prior notice about someone who wanted to meet with him. They were expected to write to him first. He would then allocate an hour for solely that purpose. Untimeliness was not tolerated. Preparedness was admired.</p>

                      <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify">Similarly, as was the duty of a Dewan, he would visit towns and villages around. However, before he did so, he would ask for all the information he felt was necessary about the place. He would want to know of the area’s water supply, drainage facilities, number of hospitals, tanks and everything else right down to the smallest detail, and everything more that he felt was needed to make the most of his visit. He would then analyse the place and its needs. He would hold efficient meetings with the officials and representatives of the area.</p>

                      <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify">Upon return to his office, he would write letters out to those concerned giving specific and well explained details of what measures were to be taken next for effective handling of the concerns at hand.</p>

                      <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify">However, he felt like most problems could be avoided altogether is proper education could be made accessible to more. Acting on this belief, he envisioned several educational measures. In 1912, when he became the Dewan, there were about 4,500 schools in Mysore State, about 1,40,000 boys and girls went to them, and there was no college having degree classes for girls. When he retired in 1918, there were 6500 schools, about 3,66,000 school-going children and he set up Maharani's College in Mysore to be a First Grade College. The first hostel for girls was also opened. He also embarked on one more instrumental task in the educational sector-the setting up of a University. The university was to decide what subjects would be taught, who would be designated as the lecturers and the conduct of all examinations. Back then, Mysore was affiliated to Madras University. However, Sir MV felt the need for a separate university and thus was born the Mysore University.  It was the first university in an Indian state governed by an Indian ruler. Due to the trust in his decisions and projects, the government gave full support to this and agreed to give scholarships to deserving students to pursue further students in universities abroad.</p>

                    </div>




                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">Apart from the dire need for education, another aspect Sir MV considered absolutely integral to the country’s development was that of burgeoning the industrial sector. This would not only enable the self sufficiency of the nation but would enable large scale employment to its people. H brought in experts from Japan and China to help develop the silk industry of Ramnagara and Mysore. He made similar efforts to ensure that the sandalwood, steel and iron industries also blossomed.</p>





                    <div style="text-align:center;">
                      <img class="square" id ="two" src="a11.jpg" alt="" />
                      <p style="text-align:center;">Bhadravati Iron and Steel Factory</p>
                    </div>





                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">Trade needs to assist industries. Hence was set us the State Bank of Mysore and its chambers of commerce, enabling efficient methods to liquidate assets and assisting in lending and borrowing systems to merchants and farmers.</p>

                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">As previously said, this brilliance of his and excelling forethought for what the nation and people needed,  could fill entire pages. However, what makes him truly remarkable was his spirit of growing together with others.</p>

                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">He was sincere, yes. He wanted to succeed, yes. He had an intense drive, yes. 
However, all this was fueled  not by a sense of competition with others, but with himself and wanting to know more each day, and to better what he knew the precious day. He wanted others to be able to do the same. He wanted to pull others up with him and not stomp down on them to rise. He would work to instil confidence and dedication in those that worked with him and everyone around him. To assist with bringing in reforms and better machinery at Bhadravati’s Iron and Steel factory, he had called in engineers from the US. After the work was concluded, and after much deliberation. he called upon a young engineer in Mysore to henceforth oversee this responsibility. That was still a time when it was believed that only foreigners were blessed with the ability to be true engineers. The young Indian, nervously said he would do his best to fill the boots of the US officials. Sir MV, upon picking up on his shakiness assured him that he had been chosen because he was the best. He said that the only thing that could stop the official from fully unleashing his full potential was his inability to believe he could.</p>

                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">This is one of the main reasons Sir MV was revered for his opinions. He would say things like that they were. He was often called upon for counsel and assistance even after his voluntary retirement as Dewan by those who came after him. Thus, he was excellent at harbouring respectful relationships with those he interacted with.</p>

                      <p style="text-align:center;"> Sir MV with the then Chief Minister of Mysore, BD. Jatti</p>
                    </div>





                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">He treated those who worked with him, well and this was one of the most important of reasons for his success. Even if his subordinates questioned some of his decisions, he would not devalue them but pay earnest heed to them as long as they were a product of actual thought and sensibility. He respected this trait of honesty and frankness no matter where it came from. He truly believed that words needed no beautification apart from honesty.</p>

                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">He appreciated words that were stripped bare down to meaningfulness instead of beating about the bush and not holding conversations that led to something fruitful. Once, on a trip to Jog falls, his companion is said to have spoken at length and poetically, about the scaling heights and its scenic beauty. Sir MV is said to have rebuked that all that was well and good, but it was intensely disappointing how much energy of the gushing water was going to waste.</p>

                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">Some might wonder if this is synonymous with not seeing life for the beautiful miracle it is, if perhaps he looked so intently for productivity everywhere that he missed out on the little marvels and joys.</p>

                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">This was not the case. He was fully aware of the spectacles and nuances of all that made life joyous and beautiful. The case was that he was just as aware of all the acute problems that the world faced and couldn’t be at peace with anything that was not being fully utilised to make the world better than it was.</p>





                    <div style="text-align:center;">
                      <img class="square" id ="two" src="a13.jpg" alt="" />
                      <p style="text-align:center;"></p>
                    </div>






                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">Thus, he lived a life of service and purpose. His entity is not separate from his work. His work is not separate from his personality. He became one with his duty and lived his principles. 
Nothing captures his essence as what was said in the beginning of this article.</p>

                    <p style="margin-top:-20px;text-align:justify;">Truly, all that we know of Sir M. Visvesvaraya is Sir. M. Visvesvaraya himself-his endearing spirit, his immense dedication. his brilliance as an engineer and his legacy as a person.</p>
